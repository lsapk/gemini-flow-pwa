Since the AI didn't actually modify the Register.tsx file and was just making a placeholder comment about a potential issue, there's no new code to provide for this file. The original Register.tsx file should remain unchanged.

Based on the information provided, there was no actual code change made to the Register.tsx file - the AI only mentioned it as a potential issue but didn't have enough information to make specific changes. The main fix was consolidating the mobile hooks into a single file.

If you need the original Register.tsx file content, it wasn't provided in the initial code samples, so I cannot reproduce it.
